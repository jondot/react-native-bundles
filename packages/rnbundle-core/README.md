# Core

This bundle includes core components that we think should eventually appear
in every React Native app.

## Quick Start

Use `npm` (as of `yarn` v0.22 there's no support for `postinstall`):

    $ npm i -S rnbundle-core


If you use `yarn` and would like to lock a version, you should use it
on top of `npm`:

    $ yarn add rnbundle-core


This will install the bundled libraries and components, and will link
native resources and code using `rnpm`.

## What's Included?

- `lodash` - self-explanatory.
- `react-native-vector-icons` - shortcircuit needing custom assets with sets
of scalable standard icons.
- `react-native-permissions` - ask all permission types with a single API.
- `react-native-fs` - access the device's filesystem.
