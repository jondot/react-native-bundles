# Redux

This bundle includes state management with Redux. This means Redux itself
and the React binding, as well as thunks, promise, logging middleware and immutable.

## Quick Start

Use `npm` (as of `yarn` v0.22 there's no support for `postinstall`):

    $ npm i -S rnbundle-redux


If you use `yarn` and would like to lock a version, you should use it
on top of `npm`:

    $ yarn add rnbundle-redux


This will install the bundled libraries and components, and will link
native resources and code using `rnpm`.
